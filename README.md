No longer will my GitHub streaks be less than perfect!

Enjoy this pseudorandom image:

Known issue: there are some images missing from some of these placement services; they just don't have certain size combinations. Sorry if no image has appeared.

If you're trying to run this yourself, _on a Mac_, you can put the com.github.api.plist file into **/Library/LaunchAgents**, to have it run daily at 8:25am, your local time, no matter which user is logged into your machine. Your Python path is pretty likely to match mine, but you'll definitely have to substitute the full path of where you put the .py file. :)
